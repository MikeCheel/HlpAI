NOTE: This is a placeholder for a DOCX file since binary DOCX files cannot be created with text tools.

To test DOCX functionality properly:
1. Create a real .docx file using Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer
2. Add some sample content like:
   - Headings and formatted text
   - Tables and lists  
   - Images (will be ignored by text extractor)
   - Various fonts and styles
3. Save it as "report.docx" in this folder
4. The TextFileExtractor will handle .docx files if configured

Expected behavior:
- File Type: DOCX (Microsoft Word Document)  
- Extractor: TextFileExtractor (with custom extension)
- MIME Type: text/plain (handled as text)
- Content: Only text content extracted, formatting removed

Sample content for a real DOCX:
