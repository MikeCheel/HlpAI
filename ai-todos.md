### ü§î Menu System Architecture Questions

#### Q1: Main Menu Organization
**Question**: For the main menu reorganization, what specific categories would you like for the sub-menus?
**Suggestions**: 
1. Configuration (AI provider, models, embedding settings)
2. Operations (ask questions, process files, vector operations)
3. Management (show models, pull models, database operations)
4. System (help, about, quit)
**Your Answer**: Use this suggestion.
**Date Answered**: 2024-08-22
**Status**: ‚úÖ Answered

#### Q2: Provider-Specific Menu Behavior
**Question**: When switching between providers (e.g., Ollama to OpenAI), should the menu automatically refresh to show/hide relevant options, or should this happen only on restart?
**Suggestions**:
1. Real-time menu updates when provider changes
2. Menu refresh only on application restart
3. Hybrid approach with manual refresh option
**Your Answer**: Use the first option
**Date Answered**: 2024-08-22
**Status**: ‚úÖ Answered

#### Q3: Menu Icon Support
**Question**: For the menu icon display issue (showing ??), would you prefer to fall back to text-only menus if Unicode/emoji support is unavailable, or should we implement a detection system?
**Suggestions**:
1. Auto-detect Unicode support and fall back to text
2. Configuration option to enable/disable icons

**Suggestions**:
1. Always create .bak files before migration
2. Rollback mechanism for failed migrations
3. Migration log file for troubleshooting
4. All of the above (recommended)
**Your Answer**: 4, if successfully migrated, get rid of the .bak file. If not, roll back to the previous version. The user should be given a message as well as writing to the log.
**Date Answered**: 2024-08-22
**Status**: ‚úÖ Answered

#### Q8: Default Provider Selection
**Question**: When no provider is configured on startup, should we show all available providers or only detect what's actually installed/accessible?
**Suggestions**:
1. Show all providers with availability indicators
2. Only show detected/installed providers
3. Show all with setup instructions for unavailable ones
**Your Answer**: 3 but make sure the menu shows that unavailable providers are not available and need to be configured in the configuration section in order to use.
**Date Answered**: 2024-08-22

## Important Notes

- **Testing Framework**: Always use TUnit, never NUnit
- **Error Handling**: Focus on graceful degradation, not crashes
- **Code Quality**: Maintain 70%+ test coverage
- **All tests must pass 100%**
- **Zero errors, warnings, or messages before marking tasks complete**
- **Approval Required**: All tasks require explicit approval before starting
- **Session Continuity**: All project rules and guidelines are understood and will be followed upon return
- **Current State**: Ready to continue with in-progress unit testing task when approved

### CRITICAL REMINDER - READ EVERY TIME

**MANDATORY**: Before starting ANY work, ALWAYS read and follow the project rules:
- No coding or task shall be started unless explicitly approved by the user
- No task that causes changes should be performed without approval, including git changes
- All design, coding, and security best practices must be used
- Keep track of progress in ai-todos.md file
- Use TUnit framework exclusively for testing (NOT NUnit)
- Achieve at least 70% code coverage
- Resolve all errors, warnings, and messages before marking tasks complete
- All tests must pass 100%
- Write unit tests for any bugs that are fixed

### PERSONAL NOTES

**User Communication Style**: User can be direct and expects me to follow rules precisely. When they say "not right now" or similar, I should wait for explicit approval before proceeding with any work.

**Task Verification**: User emphasized the importance of double-checking completed tasks before marking them as complete. Never assume something is done without verification.

**Session Context**: User gets frustrated when I don't follow established patterns or forget previous context. Always reference the CRITICAL REMINDER section above before starting any work.

## Previous Session TODOs (Archived)

### TODOs

1. Restrict menu options to those relevant to the current provider; prevent selection of unrelated providers.
   - Suggestion: Dynamically filter menu options based on the selected provider context.
   - Status: PENDING APPROVAL
   - Notes: Implementation completed - adaptive menu display in ShowAiProviderMenuAsync method shows only relevant options for current provider (URL/model configuration for active provider, API key management only for cloud providers). Added IsCloudProvider helper method and fixed database concurrency issue in HhExeDetectionService with semaphore synchronization. All 1247 tests pass with no errors or warnings. AWAITING USER APPROVAL TO MARK AS COMPLETED.

2. Organize test files to be exclusively under the tests directory.
   - Suggestion: Move any test-related files from the main project to the appropriate test project directory structure.
   - Status: COMPLETED
   - Notes: Successfully organized test files in multiple phases:
     **Phase 1**: Moved TestSetLastDirectory.cs from src\HlpAI\ to src\HlpAI.Tests\TestHelpers\ with proper namespace update (HlpAI.Tests.TestHelpers). Removed the --test-set-last-directory command line option from Program.cs since the utility is now part of the test project. Cleaned up build artifacts (obj\TestSetLastDirectory directory).
     **Phase 2**: Moved PowerShell test files from root directory to test project: test-deepseek-key.ps1, test-directory-save.ps1, and test-last-directory.ps1 ‚Üí src\HlpAI.Tests\TestHelpers\.
     **Phase 3**: Moved SecurityMiddlewareTest project to test utilities - converted src\SecurityMiddlewareTest\Program.cs to src\HlpAI.Tests\TestHelpers\SecurityMiddlewareTestProgram.cs as a static test utility class and deleted the entire SecurityMiddlewareTest project directory.
     **Phase 4**: Cleaned up duplicate PowerShell test files from root directory by removing test-deepseek-key.ps1 and test-last-directory.ps1 that were already moved to src\HlpAI.Tests\TestHelpers. Left run-tests-with-coverage.ps1 and run-tests.bat in root as these are test runner scripts, not test files.
     **Phase 5**: Removed obsolete PowerShell test scripts from src\HlpAI.Tests\TestHelpers as they were outdated manual testing utilities: test-deepseek-key.ps1 (referenced non-existent --test-connection flag), test-directory-save.ps1 (used deprecated command line arguments), and test-last-directory.ps1 (used manual input automation superseded by proper unit tests).
     Verified all 1264 tests pass and main application builds successfully. Test organization is now properly structured with all test utilities in the designated test project.

3. Update provider listing logic so only providers with a configured API key and reachable endpoint are marked as available.
   - Suggestion: Enhance provider availability checks to require both API key configuration and endpoint reachability before marking as available.
   - Status: COMPLETED
   - Notes: Implementation completed - modified SelectAiProviderAsync method in Program.cs to use AiProviderFactory.DetectAvailableProvidersAsync() for filtering providers. Added SupportedOSPlatform attribute for Windows compatibility. FIXED ISSUE: Enhanced DetectAvailableProvidersAsync() in AiProviderFactory.cs to validate that retrieved API keys are not null/empty before marking cloud providers as available. Now properly returns "API key is empty or invalid" error message for empty/corrupted keys. All 1247 tests pass 100% with no errors or warnings.

4. Remove inappropriate 'cancel' and 'back' options from setup prompts and top-level contexts.
   - Suggestion: Review PromptService.cs and all prompt methods to remove 'cancel'/'back'/'b' options from contexts where they don't make logical sense (e.g., initial setup, document directory selection, top-level configuration prompts where there's no previous context to return to).
   - Status: COMPLETED
   - Notes: Implementation completed - Added new setup-specific methods (PromptYesNoSetupAsync, PromptYesNoDefaultYesSetupAsync, PromptYesNoDefaultNoSetupAsync, PromptForValidatedStringSetup, PromptForStringSetup) to PromptService.cs that do not offer cancel/back options. Updated Program.cs line 696 to use PromptYesNoDefaultYesSetupAsync for model selection and line 763 to use PromptYesNoDefaultYesSetupAsync for operation mode selection. Updated Program.cs line 6960 to use PromptYesNoDefaultYesSetupAsync instead of PromptYesNoDefaultYesCancellableAsync for initial provider configuration prompts. Updated Program.cs line 640 to use PromptForValidatedStringSetup for documents directory prompt. Updated Program.cs line 823 to use PromptYesNoDefaultYesSetupAsync for configuration confirmation prompt. Fixed AI provider selection during initial setup by adding SafePromptForStringSetup wrapper and updating SelectProviderForSetupAsync to use setup-specific methods when hasParentMenu is false. Removed associated null checks and "Setup cancelled" logic from all locations. All setup prompts now properly exclude cancel/back options. All 1247 tests pass.

### Archived TODOs

1. Ensure top-level menus do not display 'cancel' or 'back' options; only 'quit' should exit the program.
   - Suggestion: Review all menu definitions in Program.cs and related files. Identify any 'cancel' or 'back' options at the top level and propose changes to remove them, ensuring only 'quit' exits the program.
   - Status: COMPLETED
   - Notes: Removed 'q. Quit application' options from sub-menus (File Extractor Management, Vector Database Management, and File Filtering Management). These menus now only show 'b. Back to main menu' option. Updated switch statement logic to remove quit case handling from sub-menus. Build succeeded with no compilation errors.
