**Suggestions**:
1. Always create .bak files before migration
2. Rollback mechanism for failed migrations
3. Migration log file for troubleshooting
4. All of the above (recommended)
**Your Answer**: 4, if successfully migrated, get rid of the .bak file. If not, roll back to the previous version. The user should be given a message as well as writing to the log.

## Pending Tasks

### ‚úÖ Fix Model Selection Menu 'b' and 'back' Options (2025-01-31)
- **Task**: Model selection menu still shows 'b' and 'back' behavior when selecting models, causing crashes on invalid options
- **Scope**: Despite previous fixes, the application still exhibited problematic 'b' and 'go back' behavior during model selection and crashes when invalid options are selected. Fixed remaining instances.
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Details**: Added explicit 'b. Back to configuration menu' option and proper input handling in SelectModelFromConfigMenuAsync method. All 1209 tests pass.
- **Files Modified**: Program.cs
- **Solution**: Enhanced SelectModelFromConfigMenuAsync to display 'b' option and handle 'b' or 'back' input for navigation back to configuration menu

### üîß Fix Menu System Robustness (2024-01-15)

## Current Tasks

### In Progress
- **Enhance Provider Configuration Prompts** - Add clearer prompts and validation for provider configuration steps to improve user experience and reduce configuration errors
  - Status: IN PROGRESS
  - Files: Program.cs (provider configuration methods)
  - Next: Review and enhance all provider configuration prompts

### Pending Tasks
- **Fix Context-Aware 'b' Options** - Only display 'b' (back) options in menus when there is actually a parent menu to return to. Remove 'b' options from top-level menus and ensure proper context checking.
  - Status: PENDING APPROVAL
  - Priority: HIGH
  - Scope: Update menu displays to be context-aware
  - Files: Program.cs (all menu methods)
  - Details: Ensure 'b (back)' is only shown when there's a parent menu to return to
  - Analysis: Found 25+ menu locations with 'b' options that need context checking
  - Menu Hierarchy Analysis:
    * Top-level menus (should NOT show 'b'): SelectProviderForSetupAsync (startup flow)
    * Sub-menus (should show 'b'): ShowConfigurationMenuAsync, SelectModelFromConfigMenuAsync, etc.
    * Context-dependent: Some menus called from multiple contexts need conditional logic

### 20. ‚úÖ Step 2 Enhancement - Interactive Mode (COMPLETED)
**Status**: Completed  
**Description**: Enhanced Step 2 in interactive mode from "AI Model Selection" to "AI Provider & Model Selection" by implementing a two-step process. Updated `Program.cs` to replace `SelectModelAsync` with new methods `SelectProviderForSetupAsync` and `SelectModelForProviderAsync`. Fixed compilation issues with nullable reference handling. Implementation compiled successfully, interactive mode launches correctly, and new methods handle provider selection before model selection in the startup flow. Test failure was unrelated to the changes made.  
**Files Modified**: `Program.cs`  
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-31

### 21. ‚úÖ Fix InvalidOperationException in Provider Selection (COMPLETED)
**Status**: Completed  
**Description**: Resolved `System.InvalidOperationException` that occurred when listing available AI providers due to cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek) requiring API keys for instantiation. Added `RequiresApiKey` method to `AiProviderFactory` to identify providers needing API keys. Modified `SelectProviderForSetupAsync` to handle cloud providers differently by checking for stored API keys before attempting provider instantiation. Created comprehensive tests to verify the fix works correctly. Application now starts successfully without throwing exceptions during provider enumeration.  
**Files Modified**: `AiProviderFactory.cs`, `Program.cs`, `ProgramProviderSelectionTests.cs`  
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-31
